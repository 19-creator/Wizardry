In particular, it manifests itself in naturally occurring crystals, which can be found embedded in rocks underground. @wands Wands@ can store mana within them, and this mana is channeled into the @spells@ that you cast. Different spells require different amounts of mana, depending on how powerful they are and how long they last.",

				"It is widely accepted that mana cannot be created or destroyed, and that when a spell is cast, the mana it channels is simply dissipated into the surroundings. Indeed, this is how the vast majority of mana exists - spread thinly throughout the world. However, to be of any use, it must be concentrated, either naturally over thousands of years, as is the case with crystals underground, or artificially - an advanced subject covered later in this book. There also exist various ways of making spells more mana-efficient and recovering some of the mana dissipated during spellcasting."

				"#image magic_wand",

				"Most wands begin their life as a simple arrangement of a magic crystal of some sort attached to a wooden stick, with a gold nugget affixed to the other end. The crystal is, of course, the source of the wand's power, as it provides the focus necessary to channel @spells@. The rest of the wand is important too though, as it provides not only a means with which to hold the wand, but also a path through which @mana@ can be channeled and directed.",

				"As more spells are cast with a wand, it grows more effective at channeling @spells@, and can therefore cast spells of greater power. This effect can be discerned from subtle changes that occur in the shape and appearance of the wand itself: as a wand grows more powerful, its crystal will become more vibrant, it may change in color depending on its element, and after a while, the wood from which it is made will start to grow and twist into more complex shapes.",

				"When holding a wand, a small heads-up display will show in the corner of the screen. This indicates the spell that is currently selected along with a pictorial representation of it, and, if the spell has been cast, a cooldown bar indicating the time until that spell can be cast again. It also shows the names of the next and previous spells bound to the wand. To switch between spells, use the #next_spell_key and #previous_spell_key keys (these can be changed in options -> controls). You can also switch spells by scrolling the mouse wheel while sneaking.",

				"When viewing an inventory, hovering over a wand will display how much @mana@ is stored in it, along with its currently selected @spells spell@ and any specific abilities it may have. More in-depth information about a wand can be viewed by placing it in an @arcane_workbench arcane workbench@."

Spell books can be found throughout the world and it will not take long for you to come across one. When you do find one, you can mouse over the spell book to see basic information about the spell at a glance. You can also right-click whilst holding a spell book to read more detailed information about the spell.",

				"Scrolls, on the other hand, serve a different purpose: right-clicking whilst holding one will cast the spell that is bound to it, destroying the scroll in the process. Like spell books, scrolls can be found throughout the world, but you can also make them yourself by crafting a blank scroll from a piece of paper and some string. You can then bind a spell to the scroll using the @arcane_workbench arcane workbench@, but only if you have knowledge of that spell (see @enchanting_scrolls Enchanting Scrolls@). Scrolls are quite useful when you need to use a spell once or twice on a particular quest but don't want it to take up a slot on your @wands wand@. It should be noted, however, that scrolls are at best an inefficient method of casting spells.",

				"To the untrained eye, the magical runes with which spells are written are unreadable. In order to identify a spell, you could, of course, cast it and see what happens - though doing so may cause unwanted side-effects, and many spells need certain conditions in order to work. A safer and more reliable option is to use a scroll of identification, which can be found in chests or purchased from a wizard. Right-clicking whilst holding one will identify the first unknown spell book or scroll on your hotbar, consuming the scroll of identification in the process."

There are numerous reports of wizards becoming trapped within containment fields and slowly being driven insane, perhaps by claustrophobia.

				"Magic crystals normally form naturally underground over thousands of years, by gradually drawing latent mana from the surrounding rock as they grow. Crystalline structures are very good at absorbing and holding mana, hence the mana is naturally drawn towards them. Given the right conditions, however, it is possible to greatly speed up this process. This has given rise to the advanced technique of crystal growing, which requires both great patience and attention to detail.",

				"In order to encourage crystal growth, one must begin with a crystal seed. The most effective seeds have proven to be crystal shards, obtained by simply shattering a magic crystal into pieces. A crystal seed must then be planted into some kind of substrate, usually rock, although other materials are also viable. Left alone, this would produce a sizeable crystal in hundreds of years, depending on the conditions.",

				"To reduce this length of time, several things can be done. Immersing the seed and substrate in mineral-rich water helps with crystal growth, but not with concentrating mana. To concentrate mana more quickly, two techniques can be employed: firstly, surrounding the growth site with lesser mana-gathering objects allows the crystal to draw from them, meaning the surrounding environment is constantly replenished with mana. Too many, however, and they begin to draw mana away from the growing crystal. Secondly, mana can be drawn through some materials better than others: air is very poor at this, whereas dense materials tend to be much better. Some wizards have taken to experimentation with exotic, magical, or even otherworldy materials to try and improve crystal growth. Some even claim to have altered the type of crystal that is formed in this way.",

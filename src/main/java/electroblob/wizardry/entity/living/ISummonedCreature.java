/**
 * Interface for all summoned creatures. The code for summoned creatures has been overhauled in Wizardry 2.1, and this
 * interface allows summoned creatures to extend vanilla (or indeed modded) entity classes, so
 * <code>EntitySummonedZombie</code> now extends <code>EntityZombie</code>, for example. This change has two major
 * benefits:
 * <p>
 * - There is no longer any need for separate render classes, because summoned creatures are now instances of vanilla
 * types. <i>You don't even need to assign a render class</i> because the supertype should already be assigned the
 * correct one.<br>
 * - Summoned creature classes are now much more robust when it comes to changes between Minecraft versions, since none
 * of the vanilla code needs to be copied.
 * <p>
 * <b>Summoned creatures that do not emulate vanilla entities do not directly implement this interface</b>. Instead,
 * they should extend the abstract base implementation, {@link EntitySummonedCreature}.
 * <p>
 * All damage dealt by ISummonedCreature instances is redirected via
 * {@link ISummonedCreature#onLivingAttackEvent(net.minecraftforge.event.entity.living.LivingAttackEvent)
 * ISummonedCreature.onLivingAttackEvent(LivingAttackEvent)} and replaced by an instance of
 * {@link electroblob.wizardry.util.IElementalDamage IElementalDamage} with the summoner of that creature as the source
 * rather than the creature itself. This means that kills by summoned creatures register as kills for their owner,
 * dropping xp and rare loot if that owner is a player.
 * <p>
 * Though this system is a lot better than the previous system, <i>it is not a perfect solution</i>. The old
 * EntitySummonedCreature class overrode some methods from Entity in order to add shared functionality, but this cannot
 * be done with an interface. To get around this problem, this interface contains 5 delegate methods that do the same
 * things, with the aim of centralising as much code as possible, even though it is not automatically applied.
 * <b>Implementing classes must override the corresponding methods from Entity, and within them, call the appropriate
 * delegate method in this interface.</b> It is impossible to enforce this condition, but the summoned creature will not
 * work properly unless it is adhered to. <i>The position of the delegate method call is unimportant, but by convention
 * it is usually at the start of the calling method, which avoids it being unintentionally skipped by a return
 * statement (except for methods where the result of the delegate method should itself be returned).</i>
 * <p>
 * It is recommended that when implementing this interface, you begin by copying {@link EntitySummonedCreature} to
 * ensure all the relevant methods are duplicated. You can then change the superclass, override any additional methods
 * and add functionality to any that are already overridden. You will always want to override the AI methods at the very
 * least.
 * <p>
 * Due to the limitations of interfaces, some methods that really ought to be protected are public. These are clearly
 * marked as 'Internal, DO NOT CALL'. <b>Don't call them, only implement them.</b>
 * 
 * @since Wizardry 2.1

/* Quite honestly, this is not what default methods are really for. However, this is modding, and in modding some

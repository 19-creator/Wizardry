/**
 * This class is a generic superclass for all <b>non-directed</b> projectiles, namely: darkness orb, firebolt, firebomb,
 * force orb, ice charge, lightning disc, poison bomb, spark, spark bomb and thunderbolt. Directed (arrow-like)
 * projectiles should instead extend {@link EntityMagicArrow}.
 * <p>
 * This class purely handles saving of the damage multiplier; EntityThrowable is pretty well suited to my purposes as it
 * is. Range is done via the velocity when the constructor is called. Caster is already handled by
 * EntityThrowable.getThrower().
 * 
 * Note that this class does not implement {@link IEntityAdditionalSpawnData}; subclasses that need to transfer extra
 * data to the client should implement that interface themselves. See {@link EntityBomb} for an example.

		// this fails and the ignoreEntity field is never set, causing the projectile to hit its thrower client-side.

		// inside a mob using commands, it wouldn't hit that mob. This is so minor that it's not worth sending a packet
		// for, though it may become more noticeable if spells firing from blocks are added.
